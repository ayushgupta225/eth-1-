struct Slot {
    uint slotId;
    string section;
    bool isOccupied;
}

slots: Maps a slotId to a Slot structure.
reservedSlots: Maps an address to a specific slot, indicating whether the employee has reserved the slot.

# Events
The contract emits the following events:

SlotAdded: Triggered when a new slot is added.
SlotReserved: Triggered when a slot is reserved by an employee.
SlotFreed: Triggered when a reserved slot is freed by an employee.
